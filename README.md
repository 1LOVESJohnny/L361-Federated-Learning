# L361 Federated Learning: Theory and Practice

This repository contains the course materials for the [**L361 Federated Learning: Theory and Practice**](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2324/L361/) course from [CaMLSys Group](https://mlsys.cst.cam.ac.uk) @ the **University of Cambridge**.
The course is taught by [Prof. Nicholas D. Lane](https://niclane.org), while the practical are run by Alexandru-Andrei Iacob and [Lorenzo Sani](https://relogu.github.io).
The materials cover practicals and project guidelines and specifications.
The practicals will be published during the term about one week before the corresponding lab session.

## Use the practicals

For the practicals, the easiest way to use this repo is to open them directly in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) using the integrated GitHub functionality.
If you wish to store your solutions in GitHub rather than Google Drive, make a fork of the repository, connect your GitHub account to Google Colab, and then press "Save to GitHub" to make a new commit to your fork.

## Mid-term projects

As mentioned in the slides, MPHil and Part III students are also expected to submit mid-term projects per the specified [guidelines](projects/Research_Project_Guidelines_MPHil_Part_III.pdf) (yes, it is same document as the final projects), with the lab report being due by the Lab 3 deadline.
[Project topics](projects/Mid_Term_Projects_MPHil_Part_III.md) are randomly assigned. The assignments will be published at the same time as Practical 2 is published.
If you have not received a project topic by then, [contact](mailto:aai30@cam.ac.uk,ls985@cam.ac.uk) the teaching assistants.

## Final projects

The most important part of this course assessment is the final project.
The guidelines are described [here](/projects/Part_II_Project_Guidelines.pdf) and [here](/projects/Research_Project_Guidelines_MPHil_Part_III.pdf) for Part II and Part III/MPhil students, respectively.
The project topics will be published later during the term.
