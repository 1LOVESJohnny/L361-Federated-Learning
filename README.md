# L361-Federated-Learning
This repository contains the course materials for the L361 Federated Learning: Theory and Practice course at the University of Cambridge.

The materials cover practicals and project guidelines and specifications. For the practicals, the easiest way to use this repo is to open them directly in Google Colab using the integrated GitHub functionality. If you wish to store your solutions in GitHub rather than Google Drive, make a fork of the repository, connect your GitHub account to Google Colab and then press "Save to GitHub" to make a new commit to your fork.

As mentioned in the slides, MPHil and Part III students are also expected to submit mid-term projects per the specified guidelines, with the lab report being due by the Lab 3 deadline. Project topics are randomly assigned, if you have not received a project topic contact the teaching assistants.
